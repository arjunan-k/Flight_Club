Hi friends, Flight Club project is a Flight Deals alert program where we can get instant messages about the flight price offers!

## Documentation

In this project I have used Three API's




- Twilio API for sending flight deals through SMS.
- Sheety API for storing user data and destinations in google sheets.
- Tequila API for searching flight deals and Iatacodes.

By this project you will be able to store your desired destination countries you want to visit and the flight charges which you can afford.
The program also has other features by which you can customize your flight journey. Like you can fix the stop overs, flight route via a favourite locations and lots more.
After setting your conditions when we run our code we will be able to get notifications through emails and SMS whenever there is a great deal in flight charges.
